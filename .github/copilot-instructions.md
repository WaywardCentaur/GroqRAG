This is a Python project implementing a real-time audio RAG agent using Groq. The project uses:
- FastAPI for the REST API
- sounddevice and webrtcvad for audio processing
- langchain for the RAG pipeline
- Groq for LLM integration
- ChromaDB for vector storage

Code should follow PEP 8 guidelines and include type hints. Each module should have appropriate documentation and error handling.
Check routes.py every time you make changes to ensure the API endpoints are correctly defined and documented.
- Check routes.py for API endpoint definitions and ensure they are correctly implemented.
- Ensure that all API endpoints are documented with appropriate descriptions and examples.
